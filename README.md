# Fluid Mechanics Fundamentals

Aerospace professionals, the decision makers, must deeply understand fluid mechanics because fluid flow governs how the vehicles and propulsion systems that we create respond, such as, lift, drag, stability, propulsion efficiency, and thermal loads across all flight regimes. Fundamental principles allow engineers to reason correctly about new configurations, off-design conditions, and failure modes where empirical data or simulations may be limited or misleading. Mastery of the fundamentals enables better modeling choices, faster intuition, and safer, more efficient aerospace systems.

This repository holds the problem sets used to deliberately practice the fundamentals on the way to mastery. :)
